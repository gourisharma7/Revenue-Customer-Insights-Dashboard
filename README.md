# Revenue-Customer-Insights-Dashboard
An interactive sales dashboard providing insights into revenue, customer trends, and product performance for data-driven decision-making.


## Implementation

The dataset was processed and structured in Excel, leveraging advanced pivot tables, charts, and slicers for dynamic filtering. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales by item, profit gained over time, regional sales distribution, top customers, and monthly sales trends were visualized to enable quick and informed decision-making.


 

## Key Metrics:


Sales by Item: Identifies top-performing products contributing to revenue.

Profit Trends: Tracks profitability growth across different categories.

Sales by State: Highlights regional demand variations for strategic planning.

Customer Count Analysis: Evaluates customer engagement over different years.

Top 5 Customers: Recognizes high-value clients for targeted retention strategies.

Monthly Sales Trends: Monitors seasonality and sales fluctuations over time.
 

## Actionable Insights:

Revenue Trends: The highest revenue was recorded in 2017. Consider analyzing what worked that year (marketing, pricing, demand) and replicate it in future strategies.

Top Product Category: Mountain Bikes generated $3,030,776 (35.33%) of total revenue. Increasing stock, offering promotions, or bundling them with accessories may boost sales further.

Top Store Contribution: Baldwin Bikes (67.91%) dominates sales. Expanding this store's strategies to underperforming stores like Rowlett Bikes (11.22%) could enhance revenue.

Top Sales Rep: Marcelene Boyer generated $2,938,889 in sales. Identifying their sales tactics and training other reps accordingly could improve overall team performance.
